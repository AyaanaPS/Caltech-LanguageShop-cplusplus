Good job, one minor fix though you still have a segmentation fault when your
code receives no arguments, you should print the usage message and return with a
non-zero value (denoting an error). A minor style detail about method headers,
you should not put a space between header comments and their methods, also
usually these start with an extra "*" or "!", so for
example:



/*! This function prints foo */
void foo(void) {
... 
}



This will cause it to get picked up by doxygen or other
documentation-generating programs. Just minor style fix though, you can just
keep it in mind for future labs. Just fix the segmentation fault for full
credit.
